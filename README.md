# Ifunny Scraper
**a cli ifunny profile downloader for offline viewing**

This package was built mainly for the purpose of perusing an [ifunny](http://ifunny.co) profile and viewing
old posts. Trying to scroll far enough back through either the mobile browser or website will cause your
device to crash just from the sheer number of images it is loading in.

# Installation
```
npm install -g ifunny-scraper
```
# Usage

```
ifunny-get <username> [--save-folder=<downloadLocation>]
```
